            This painting is a partial recreation of the XIX-century Ukrainian embroidered towel of the Poltava region. Embroidered towels have multiple purposes and meanings, and each of its ornament has a certain purpose and significance. It was believed that women who embroidered towels with good thoughts and intentions would bring luck and happiness to the towelâ€™s owner. Each region had its own style and color pallet that was influenced by the way of their living.

              The ceramic rooster has become a symbol of resistance for the
              Ukrainian people. A ceramic rooster was miraculously still
              attached on top of a kitchen cabinet, in an apartment building
              that was destroyed by Russian invaders in the village of
              Borodyanka, near Kyiv. This rooster is a symbol of the invincible
              Ukrainian people, holding on to their lives and beliefs, despite
              the destruction around them.
